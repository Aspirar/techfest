                Have always been dwelling over the complexity of circuits and computer programs? Catch the current, vanquish the voltage. Walk through the chaos of electrical sophistication, coding skills and emerge as the winner. Solve the toughest circuits and come up with their practicality. Invoke, implement, innovate, initialise. It’s never always been the Transformers – CodEmb

        	<h3 class="wow fadeInUp">Problem Statement</h3>
            <p class="wow fadeInUp">
                Participants individually compete in two different rounds of the challenge. In each round, participants are assigned an embedded task. Participants need to bring their own Atmel series (only) microcontroller and related hardware or an Arduino development board and code in the Arduino IDE (only). Participants are provided the required hardware to implement the specified task in each round (except the microcontroller and related hardware).
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Round 1 -->

        <section class="row dark wow fadeIn">
            <h3 class="h-center-wrap wow fadeInUp">Round 1</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    A simple task is given to check the understanding of programming concepts.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    The participant has to raise his/her hand in order to get tagged with the timestamp after writing the code in order to tabulate their position in the ranking table.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    Now, the participant is provided with the required hardware. He/she gets a single chance to showcase the output on the hardware.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    If the participant fails to showcase the output on the hardware on the first try, he/she is disqualified immediately.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    Only a maximum of 30% of the participants are filtered into next round based on their ranking.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    If the expected number of participants are unable to qualify for the next round, then the whole procedure is repeated with participants allowed to have a second try on the hardware. Participants in this case, who have accomplished the task in the first try itself, move to the next round immediately.
                </li>
            </ul>

                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    This round will test the knowledge of the participants based on simple communication protocols using a module and/or other sensors.
                </li>
                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    Participants are not allowed to use libraries other than those that are in-built in the Arduino IDE.

                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    Information about the module will be provided before 10 days to fest on the official website of the fest and in the android app.

                <li class="wow fadeInUp">
                    Top two performers based on their rank attained by a similar procedure in round 1 win the prizes.
